<h4>January 4, 2020</h4>
<p>The Institute for Defense Analyses’ (IDA) Summer Associate Program
provides students with a unique opportunity to use their quantitative
and analytic skills to work on challenging real-world national security
issues. Positions are available with a variety of foci. Projects from
past years have included functional data analysis, Bayesian approaches
to reliability estimation, and statistics in science policy.</p>
<p>IDA is a not-for-profit corporation that operates federally funded
research and development centers (FFRDCs). Two of these are accepting
summer associates.</p>
<p>Staff at the IDA Systems and Analyses Center (SAC) provide objective
analyses of national security issues, particularly those requiring
scientific and technical expertise, and conduct related research on
other national challenges. SAC, located in Alexandria, Virginia, is
comprised of the following eight research divisions:</p>
<p>Cost Analysis and Research Information Technology and Systems
Intelligence Analyses Joint Advanced Warfighting Operational Evaluation
System Evaluation Science and Technology Strategy, Forces, and Resources
Staff at the IDA Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI), located
in Washington, DC, assist the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy and other executive branch agencies in formulating
federal science and technology policy by providing high-quality,
objective, analytical support to inform policymakers.</p>
<p>Each year, IDA hires paid student associates at its Virginia and
Washington, DC, facilities to work a minimum of 10 weeks during the
summer months. Attendance at the nine-week core period between June 8,
2020, and August 7, 2020, is required. An additional week either before
or after the core period is required for a complete 10-week internship.
In some cases, opportunities exist for associates to work a few weeks
longer than the 10-week minimum.</p>
<p>The wage range is dependent on the field of study and years of
education completed. For students living outside the area, IDA pays for
one instance of round-trip travel. Associates are responsible for living
expenses during the summer.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. Citizenship is required</li>
<li>Ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance is required</li>

<div id="january-17" class="section level4">
<h4>January 17</h4>
<p>The QSURE program is an NCI funded internship program, designed to
provide a hands-on research experience to undergraduates with an
aptitude for and interest in quantitative sciences in cancer. Students
will participate in an individual research project and receive exposure
to methods in biostatistics, epidemiology and health outcomes research.
Through the program, students will advance their quantitative skills and
knowledge, as well as their understanding of options for graduate study
and careers in these areas. Student research projects will be
individualized and will address topics such as factors that improve
cancer survival, building models to predict individuals at high risk of
cancer, cancer risk factors and prevention, computational biology/cancer
genetics and genomics, quality and cost of cancer care,
treatment-related side effects in cancer survivors, and disparities in
cancer care and outcomes.</p>
<p>Competitive applicants must have a keen interest in cancer and
population health, demonstrated aptitude in data analysis, and excellent
oral and written communication skills. The program provides a modest
stipend for the 10-week summer internship at the Department of
Epidemiology and Biostatistics, located in midtown Manhattan. Students
are responsible for their own housing, but QSURE will provide a nominal
reimbursement for housing expenses.</p>

<h4>January 31</h4>
<p>The Data Science for Social Good Fellowship is a full-time summer
program to train aspiring data scientists to work on machine learning,
data science, and AI projects with social impact in a fair and equitable
manner. Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows take on
real-world problems in education, health, criminal justice,
sustainability, public safety, workforce development, human services,
transportation, economic development, international development, and
more.</p>
<p>For three months they learn, hone, and apply their data science,
analytical, and coding skills, collaborate in a fast-paced atmosphere,
and learn from full-time mentors coming from industry and academia.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>Although we’d love to have people at all levels involved, we prefer
you to be a graduate student or at least a senior in college to get the
most out of this program. This is because we have learned over the years
that fellows with prior skills are able to both get the most out of
their experience, as well as contribute the most. That said, if you feel
like you may not fit the typical criteria of a Fellow, but have both the
computational skills and passion to excel, we’d still love to see your

Undergraduates and by the Bronfman Science Center of Williams College.
Around 500 students have participated in the project since its inception
in 1988. Students work in small groups directed by individual faculty
members. Many participants have published papers and presented talks at
research conferences based on work done in SMALL. Some have gone on to
complete PhDs in Mathematics and related fields.</p>
<p>During off hours, students enjoy the many attractions of summer in
the Berkshires: hiking, biking, plays, concerts, etc. Weekly lunches,
teas, and casual sporting events bring SMALL students together with
faculty and other students spending the summer doing research at
Williams College. Participating students receive a stipend of about
$4000. Several board plans are available at reasonable rates, with
housing included for free. There are funds to help with travel to/from
SMALL, as well as to support students to go to conferences to present
their work. Students are required to live on campus to participate in
the SMALL program. Having students live together on campus allows for
the mathematical interaction to expand beyond the boundaries of the
workday.</p>
