# Setup

This is a simple website created with R Markdown. 

To create the website, I created a new GitHub repository with an R .gitignore template. 

I cloned this repo to my desktop.

I then created a new RStudio Project from the existing repo directory. 

Under the build menu, I configured the project build tools to build a Website from the (Project Root) directory. 

On GitHub, I set up the Pages settings to deploy from the */docs* directory on the main branch.

The */docs* directory is created and updated automatically on site build. 

I had to create the *_site.yml* to control the theme and navigation bar. 

I also have a simple *style.css* file to customize the font and table of contents.
